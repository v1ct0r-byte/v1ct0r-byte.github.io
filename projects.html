                <h2>Formal Analysis and Verification of Post-Quantum Cryptographic Protocols (<a href="https://vrain.upv.es/favpqc/">FAVPQC</a>)</h2>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                
                <p>
                    The project aims to formally analyse post-quantum cryptographic protocols by focusing on lattice-based and code-based. To the best of our knowledge, there needs to be more known formal analyses for these protocols. Moreover, it's known that formal analysis of post-quantum cryptosystems has yet to be studied deeply. In the project's scope, we will use Maude, and its based tool Maude-NPA, to analyse postquantum cryptographic protocols. The methods used in the project are based on studying search and decision problems and different interpretations of algebraic techniques. We will adopt these methodologies to encode and (semi)-automatically analyse post-quantum cryptosystems in Maude frameworks and in an extended Maude-NPA version.

                    The project scope it to formally reason and develop ideas around the concept of Protocol Dialects. The tools involved are the high performance language Maude and its related security tool Maude-NPA. A first publication is available in <b>[TBA]</b>.
